Cycle local or global visibility.

Without a prefix argument call `bicycle-cycle-local'.

Cycle visibility of all sections.

1. OVERVIEW: Show only top-level headings.

(2. There is equivalent of `bicycle-cycle-local's CHILDREN state.)

3. TOC:      Recursively show all headings,
             without treating code blocks as sections.

4. TREES:    Recursively show all headings,
             treating code blocks as sections
             (i.e., their first line is treated as a heading).

5. ALL:      Show everything, including code blocks,
             empty lines and comments.
             However, do not expand code blocks that were
             previously collapsed individually.

In situations when cycling to a state makes no difference compared
to the previous state, then immediately continue to the next state." t)
